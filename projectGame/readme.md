## Background
In default the map layout is 32_32 inside the background.cpp engine and must be noted when working with GRIT.
###Grit
This means we set grit map & palette to u16 setting.
For the Tiles u32 is adviced.
###GBA-TileEditor
With this program we can chose the map layout size and insert a tileset to design a costume scene/map
